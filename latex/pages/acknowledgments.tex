Firstly, of course, I have to thank my supervisor Tobias Lasser! We have been working together now
for more than 5 years. It all started with a bachelor Seminar, turned into my bachelor's thesis,
followed by many years of research assistant positions.

During the last years of my studies, I found myself struggling with the pressure and stress.
Tobias always supported me in many different ways, writing letters of recommendation, providing me
an amazing opportunity to do an intership in Denmark, providing me access to facilities or just
show interest in weird my intererst.

I sincerely thank Tobias, for the freedome he offered me. During all the different projects we worked on,
I never had the feeling of doing something, I was forced to and did not like myself.
Raterh, it was the other way around. I could come up with esoteric ideas and given enough reason,
I could spend time on it and explore. This is and was a great way to grow for me personally. And
I can't thank him enough for that.

Then I also want to thank my family. I want to thank my parents. They supported me in many different
ways thorughout my studies. Of course, they provided me with the chances to my education and
supported me financially.

Lastly, I want to thank - in no particular order - Magi, Luzi, Mira, Eli, Anna, Phillip, Alex, Alaya,
Magda for everything. For all the discussions, late night talks, walks, breakfest talks, coffee breaks.
For all the emotional support, for putting up with me in all my different moods, for providing
distraction from my moods.

Without all of you, I would have not made it.
