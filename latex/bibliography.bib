	abstract = {B-splines are attractive basis functions for the continuous-domain representation of biomedical images and volumes. In this paper, we prove that the extended family of box splines are closed under the Radon transform and derive explicit formulae for their transforms. Our results are general; they cover all known brands of compactly-supported box splines (tensorproduct B-splines, separable or not) in any number of dimensions. The proposed box spline approach extends to non-Cartesian lattices used for discretizing the image space. In particular, we prove that the 2-D Radon transform of an N -direction box spline is generally a (non-uniform) polynomial spline of degree N − 1. The proposed framework allows for a proper discretization of a variety of tomographic reconstruction problems in a box spline basis. It is of relevance for imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography and cryo-electron microscopy.},

	title = {Anisotropic {X}-ray {Dark}-field {Tomography}},
	abstract = {Modern X-ray based imaging enables recording of phase-contrast (refraction) and dark-field
(Small Angle X-ray Scattering) information using Talbot-Lau interferometry. These X-ray
imaging modalities provide improved contrast where standard absorption based imaging
only provides poor to none. The task of Computed Tomography (CT) amounts to recon-
struction of the physical quantities within the imaged object which caused a specific obser-
vation/measurement. A major prerequisite for tomographic reconstruction is first a model
of the physical properties, e.g. using scalars, vectors or tensors. Second, a forward model is
required which enables simulation of measurements from a given 3D representation of the
physical properties. For X-ray based absorption CT, this describes the task of computing the
accumulative effect on the X-ray beam traversing through the object. The combination of a
forward model and corresponding measurements form an inverse problem. Mathematically,
the task of CT corresponds to the inversion of the forward model which can be computed
using according numerical methods.
While tomographic reconstruction for modalities different than X-ray CT often employs very
similar mathematical concepts, software frameworks are often strictly focused on a specific
modality. The first contribution presented in this thesis is the development of an abstract
software framework for tomographic reconstruction. Within this framework the numerical
methods are implemented independently from the specific forward model which enables
adaptation and application of methods for multiple modalities. Additionally, the framework
supports the composition of various common approaches such as regularization methods which
allows for intensive comparison and evaluation of specific methods for multiple modalities.
Within the scope of this work, this framework will be applied to tomographic reconstruction
of the dark-field signal.
Reconstruction of the dark-field signal poses a particularly challenging problem, as the
scattering within an object depends on the X-ray beam’s direction as well as the grating
orientation in contrast to absorption and phase-contrast imaging. Thus, the physical quantity
at each position cannot be modeled by a scalar entity, but requires a more complex model
instead. A first method has been presented previously in form of X-ray Tensor Tomography
(XTT) where a rank-2 tensor is used to describe the scattering happening in each location of
the measured object. This tensor combines information on the scattering strength as well as
its directional distribution which provides an insight into orientation of microstructures within
the object.
A major limitation of the XTT approach is that a tensor is restricted to a single microstructure
direction. In order to cope with this problem within this thesis a general closed-form, continu-
ous forward model of the Anisotropic X-ray Dark-field Tomography will be presented. This
vii
model contains the XTT model under specific assumptions and in addition enables the tomo-
graphic reconstruction of a spherical function representing the whole scattering profile in each
location of the object. This novel approach provides strongly improved reconstructions using
spherical harmonics. All this is achieved at a computational complexity comparable to that
required by XTT. Additionally, an approach to extract the orientation of the microstructures
causing the scattering will be presented. Experiments show that the method of AXDT is capa-
ble of reconstructing multiple scattering orientations and the corresponding microstructure
orientations.
Finally, a first biomedical experiment on a sample of a human cerebellum indicates that AXDT
could provide a complementary imaging modality for imaging nerve fibers within the Central
Nervous System (CNS).},

@phdthesis{von_teuffenbach_statistical_nodate,
	title = {Statistical signal processing and reconstruction algorithms for grating-based {X}-ray imaging and computed tomography},
	abstract = {Grating-based X-ray interferometry is a novel imaging technique that offers great potential for
the visualization of materials and tissues that are not easily depicted using conventional X-ray
imaging methods. Tomographic reconstruction based on interferometric data provides not only
access to the distribution of an object’s attenuation but also to its refraction and ultra-small-
angle scattering power. These images provide valuable additional information that could well
expand the diagnostic capabilities of a clinical computer tomography (CT) scanner.
One of the main reasons why this technique has not yet been implemented in a modern CT
scanner is that the improved functionality comes at the cost of longer measurement times. Ex-
isting projection-based processing algorithms require not a single measurement per projection
angle but several measurements with precise grating movements in between. A further reason
is that these signal estimation algorithms are also very sensitive to changes in the system align-
ment due to mechanical vibrations or thermal drifts, which are abound in a clinical high-power
CT using a continuously rotating gantry.
Several solutions for these problems have been proposed but all suffer from major drawbacks.
In this thesis first two simple improvements to existing signal estimation methods are pre-
sented and then a novel direct reconstruction method is introduced. A fast algorithm for
reconstructions using this method is developed, the technique is tested at scans using just a
single measurement per angular position and further enhancements that make the reconstruc-
tions robust to vibrations and drifts are implemented and tested.
The results in this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to successfully reconstruct the attenu-
ation, refraction, and ultra-small-angle scattering of an object using only a single measurement
per projection angle on a system influenced by significant vibrations and drifts.
This is a milestone for the future implementation of a grating interferometer onto a continuously
rotating clinical CT scanner.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this work is to combine two areas of active research in tomographic x-ray imaging. The ﬁrst one is the use of iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques. The second one is differential phase contrast imaging (DPCI).
Methods: The authors derive a maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction algorithm with regularization for DPCI. Forward and back-projection are implemented using spherically symmetric basis functions (blobs) and differential footprints, thus completely avoiding the need for numerical differentiation throughout the reconstruction process. The method is applied to the problem of reconstruction of an object from sparsely sampled projections.
Results: The results show that the proposed method can handle the sparsely sampled data efﬁciently. In particular no streak artifacts are visible which are present in images obtained by ﬁltered back-projection (FBP).
Conclusions: IR algorithms have a wide spectrum of proven advantages in the area of conventional computed tomography. The present work describes for the ﬁrst time, how a matched forward and back-projection can be implemented for DPCI, which is furthermore free of any heuristics. The newly developed ML reconstruction algorithm for DPCI shows that for the case of sparsely sampled projection data, an improvement in image quality is obtained that is qualitatively comparable to a corresponding situation in conventional x-ray imaging. Based on the proposed operators for forward and back-projection, a large variety of IR algorithms is thus made available for DPCI.},

First, we construct a box spline based on the four principal directions of the BCC lattice that allows for a linear C0 reconstruction. Then, the design is extended for higher degrees of continuity. We derive the explicit piecewise polynomial representations of the C0 and C2 box splines that are useful for practical reconstruction applications. We further demonstrate that approximation in the shift-invariant space—generated by BCC-lattice shifts of these box splines—is twice as efficient as using the tensor-product B-spline solutions on the Cartesian lattice (with comparable smoothness and approximation order and with the same sampling density). Practical evidence is provided demonstrating that the BCC lattice not only is generally a more accurate sampling pattern, but also allows for extremely efficient reconstructions that outperform tensor-product Cartesian reconstructions.},

	abstract = {A method is proposed for a 3D reconstruction of coronary networks from rotational projections that departs from motion-compensated approaches. It deals with multiple views extracted from a time-stamped image sequence through ECG gating. This statistics-based vessel reconstruction method relies on a new imaging model by considering both the eﬀect of background tissues and the image representation using spherically-symmetric basis functions, also called ’blobs’ . These blobs have a closed analytical expression for the X-ray transform, which makes easier to compute a cone-beam projection than a voxel-based description. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is used with a Poisson distributed projection data instead of the Gaussian approximation often used in tomography reconstruction. A heavy-tailed distribution is proposed as image prior to take into account the sparse nature of the object of interest. The optimization is performed by an expectationmaximization like (EM) block iterative algorithm which oﬀers a fast convergence and a sound introduction of the non-negativity constraint for vessel attenuation coeﬃcients. Simulations are performed using a model of coronary tree extracted from multidetector CT scanner and a performance study is conducted. They point out that, even with severe angular undersampling (6 projections over 110 degrees for instance) and without introducing a prior model of the object, signiﬁcant results can be achieved.},

	abstract = {A method to enhance the quality of the tomographic reconstruction and, consequently, the 3D velocity measurement accuracy, is presented. The technique is based on integrating information on the objects to be reconstructed within the algebraic reconstruction process. A first guess intensity distribution is produced with a standard algebraic method, then the distribution is rebuilt as a sum of Gaussian blobs, based on location, intensity and size of agglomerates of light intensity surrounding local maxima. The blobs substitution regularizes the particle shape allowing a reduction of the particles discretization errors and of their elongation in the depth direction. The performances of the blob-enhanced reconstruction technique (BERT) are assessed with a 3D synthetic experiment. The results have been compared with those obtained by applying the standard camera simultaneous multiplicative reconstruction technique (CSMART) to the same volume. Several blob-enhanced reconstruction processes, both substituting the blobs at the end of the CSMART algorithm and during the iterations (i.e. using the blob-enhanced reconstruction as predictor for the following iterations), have been tested. The results confirm the enhancement in the velocity measurements accuracy, demonstrating a reduction of the bias error due to the ghost particles. The improvement is more remarkable at the largest tested seeding densities. Additionally, using the blobs distributions as a predictor enables further improvement of the convergence of the reconstruction algorithm, with the improvement being more considerable when substituting the blobs more than once during the process. The BERT process is also applied to multi resolution (MR) CSMART reconstructions, permitting simultaneously to achieve remarkable improvements in the flow field measurements and to benefit from the reduction in computational time due to the MR approach. Finally, BERT is also tested on experimental data, obtaining an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed flow field and a higher value of the correlation factor in the velocity measurements with respect to the volume to which the particles are not replaced.},

The forward projections are computed by convolutions of the kernel with the blob line integrals. Both ray tracing procedures presented incrementally compute the square distance r2 for each visited blob enabling the appropriate resolution kernel to be used. The second variant also computes the l coordinate along the line of response axis allowing for longitudinal variations of the resolution kernel to be considered as well as time-of-ﬂight (TOF) modeling.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this work is to combine two areas of active research in tomographic x-ray imaging. The ﬁrst one is the use of iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques. The second one is differential phase contrast imaging (DPCI).
Methods: The authors derive a maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction algorithm with regularization for DPCI. Forward and back-projection are implemented using spherically symmetric basis functions (blobs) and differential footprints, thus completely avoiding the need for numerical differentiation throughout the reconstruction process. The method is applied to the problem of reconstruction of an object from sparsely sampled projections.
Results: The results show that the proposed method can handle the sparsely sampled data efﬁciently. In particular no streak artifacts are visible which are present in images obtained by ﬁltered back-projection (FBP).
Conclusions: IR algorithms have a wide spectrum of proven advantages in the area of conventional computed tomography. The present work describes for the ﬁrst time, how a matched forward and back-projection can be implemented for DPCI, which is furthermore free of any heuristics. The newly developed ML reconstruction algorithm for DPCI shows that for the case of sparsely sampled projection data, an improvement in image quality is obtained that is qualitatively comparable to a corresponding situation in conventional x-ray imaging. Based on the proposed operators for forward and back-projection, a large variety of IR algorithms is thus made available for DPCI.},

The tomographic projection data in DPCT, from which an estimate of the refractive index distribution is reconstructed, correspond to onedimensional (1D) derivatives of the two-dimensional (2D) Radon transform of the refractive index distribution. There is an important need for the development of iterative image reconstruction methods for DPCT that can yield useful images from few-view projection data, thereby mitigating the long data-acquisition times and large radiation doses associated with use of analytic reconstruction methods. In this work, we analyze the numerical and statistical properties of two classes of discrete imaging models that form the basis for iterative image reconstruction in DPCT. We also investigate the use of one of the models with a modern image reconstruction algorithm for performing few-view image reconstruction of a tissue specimen.},

We show that, contrary to the common belief, those that perform best are not interpolating. By opposition to traditional interpolation, we call their use generalized interpolation; they involve a prefiltering step when correctly applied. We explain why the approximation order inherent in any basis function is important to limit interpolation artifacts. The decomposition theorem states that any basis function endowed with approximation order can be expressed as the convolution of a B-spline of the same order with another function that has none. This motivates the use of splines and spline-based functions as a tunable way to keep artifacts in check without any significant cost penalty. We discuss implementation and performance issues, and we provide experimental evidence to support our claims.},

In many applications, it is critical to reduce the X-ray dose while producing high-quality reconstructions. Regularization is an excellent way to do this, but in the differential phase contrast case it is usually applied in a slice-by-slice manner. We propose using fully 3D regularization to improve the dose/quality trade-off beyond what is possible using slice-by-slice regularization. To make this computationally feasible, we show that the two computational bottlenecks of our iterative optimization process can be expressed as discrete convolutions; the resulting algorithms for computation of the X-ray adjoint and normal operator are fast and simple alternatives to regridding. We validate this algorithm on an analytical phantom as well as conventional CT and differential phase contrast measurements from two real objects. Compared to the slice-by-slice approach, our algorithm provides a more accurate reconstruction of the analytical phantom and better qualitative appearance on one of the two real datasets.},

New methodologies for the analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to classiﬁcation, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data. Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of well-documented data structures and functions, oﬀers a convenient environment for the development of novel algorithms.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper introduces a nonlinear weighting scheme into the backprojection operation within the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART). It is designed for tomosynthesis imaging of objects with high-attenuation features in order to reduce limited angle artifacts.
Methods: The algorithm estimates which projections potentially produce artifacts in a voxel. The contribution of those projections into the updating term is reduced. In order to identify those projections automatically, a four-dimensional backprojected space representation is used. Weighting coefﬁcients are calculated based on a dissimilarity measure, evaluated in this space. For each combination of an angular view direction and a voxel position an individual weighting coefﬁcient for the updating term is calculated.
Results: The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown based on reconstructions of the following real three-dimensional tomosynthesis datasets: a mammography quality phantom, an apple with metal needles, a dried ﬁnger bone in water, and a human hand. Datasets have been acquired with a Siemens Mammomat Inspiration tomosynthesis device and reconstructed using SART with and without suggested weighting. Out-of-focus artifacts are described using line proﬁles and measured using standard deviation (STD) in the plane and below the plane which contains artifact-causing features. Artifacts distribution in axial direction is measured using an artifact spread function (ASF). The volumes reconstructed with the weighting scheme demonstrate the reduction of out-of-focus artifacts, lower STD (meaning reduction of artifacts), and narrower ASF compared to nonweighted SART reconstruction. It is achieved successfully for different kinds of structures: point-like structures such as phantom features, long structures such as metal needles, and ﬁne structures such as trabecular bone structures.
Conclusions: Results indicate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm to reduce typical tomosynthesis artifacts produced by high-attenuation features. The proposed algorithm assigns weighting coefﬁcients automatically and no segmentation or tissue-classiﬁcation steps are required. The algorithm can be included into various iterative reconstruction algorithms with an additive updating strategy. It can also be extended to computed tomography case with the complete set of angular data. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.4789592]},

To enhance the image quality and allow for a more accurate diagnosis, a metal artifact reduction is required. Approaches may base on a recomputation of metal influenced values or use an alternative image reconstruction technique, which is less sensitive to inconsistent raw data than the standard filtered backprojection. Here, a two-step algorithm for metal artifact reduction is proposed, which combines a 2D NFFT-based interpolation and an MLEM reconstruction with spherically symmetric basis functions (blobs). Reconstructed images have been evaluated visually and quantitatively. Experiments show that combination of a 2D NFFT-based interpolation and blobs offers an effective strategy for enhanced metal artifacts suppression.},

	abstract = {Generalized Kaiser-Bessel radial basis functions are frequently used in tomographic reconstructions, and the parameter selection can significantly impact both the qualitative and quantitative image characteristics. Currently, the blob parameters are simply selected based on the first-order approximation of a uniform object. To obtain optimal images, a detailed investigation and optimization of blob parameters is needed. In this paper, we aim at optimizing the parameters of the basis functions for optimal image representation and image reconstruction. We first represent the unknown radiotracer activity distribution as the coefficients of blob basis functions on a Bravais lattice from crystallography. We point out that the optimal sampling lattice is just the reciprocal of the lattice that achieves highest packing of equally sized spheres. Based on multidimensional sampling theorem and the Kepler conjecture (proven by Thomas C. Hales), we obtain that the body-centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonal close-packing lattices are optimal in terms of either reducing computational cost at similar image quality or improving image quality at the same computational cost. To optimize the blob parameters, we formulate two new image quality metrics-total harmonic distortion (THD) and minimum approximation error (MAE) based on the theory of approximation-to analytically characterize the blob representation errors of a nonzero uniform object and an arbitrary object, respectively. The MAE is formulated in terms of the power spectral density of an imaging object, and we use it for object-dependent blob parameter optimization. We validate the THD and MAE through numerical examples using homogeneous and heterogeneous objects, respectively. We also present 3-D blob-based image reconstructions using BCC lattice with different shape parameters to show the usefulness of the proposed optimization.},

	title = {Spherically symmetric volume elements as basis functions for image reconstructions in computed laminography},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laminography is a tomographic technique that allows three-dimensional imaging of ﬂat, elongated objects that stretch beyond the extent of a reconstruction volume. Laminography datasets can be reconstructed using iterative algorithms based on the Kaczmarz method.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to develop a reconstruction algorithm that provides superior reconstruction quality for a challenging class of problems.
METHODS: Images are represented in computer memory using coefﬁcients over basis functions, typically piecewise constant functions (voxels). By replacing voxels with spherically symmetric volume elements (blobs) based on generalized KaiserBessel window functions, we obtained an adapted version of the algebraic reconstruction technique.
RESULTS: Band-limiting properties of blob functions are beneﬁcial particular in the case of noisy projections and if only a limited number of projections is available. In this case, using blob basis functions improved the full-width-at-half-maximum resolution from 10.2 ± 1.0 to 9.9 ± 0.9 (p value = 2.3·10−4). For the same dataset, the signal-to-noise ratio improved from 16.1 to 31.0. The increased computational demand per iteration is compensated for by a faster convergence rate, such that the overall performance is approximately identical for blobs and voxels.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher complexity, tomographic reconstruction from computed laminography data should be implemented using blob basis functions, especially if noisy data is expected.},

New chips integrating multiple processors are hitting the market at a reduced cost. This high-integration, low-cost trend has just begun and is expected to bring real supercomputers to our laboratory desktops in the coming years. This paper proposes a parallel implementation of a computation-intensive algorithm for three-dimensional reconstruction, ART, that takes advantage of the computational power in modern multicore platforms. ART is a sophisticated iterative reconstruction algorithm that has turned out to be well suited for the conditions found in threedimensional electron microscopy. In view of the performance obtained in this work, these modern platforms are expected to play an important role to face the future challenges in three-dimensional electron microscopy.},

Proton therapy necessitates a high level of delivery accuracy to exploit the selective targeting imparted by the Bragg peak. For this purpose, pCT utilizes the proton beam itself to create images. The technique works by sending a low-intensity beam of protons through the patient and measuring the position, direction, and energy loss of each exiting proton. The pCT technique allows reconstruction of the volumetric distribution of the relative stopping power (RSP) of the patient tissues for use in treatment planning and pre-treatment range verification. We have investigated new ways to make the reconstruction both efficient and accurate. Better accuracy of RSP also enables more robust inverse approaches to IMPT. For IMPT, we developed a framework for performing intensity-modulation of the proton pencil beams. We expect that these developments will lead to additional project work in the years to come, which requires a regular exchange between experts in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and medical physics. We have initiated such an exchange by organizing annual workshops on pCT and IMPT algorithm and technology developments. This report is, admittedly, tilted toward our interdisciplinary work and methods. We offer a comprehensive overview of results, problems, and challenges in pCT and IMPT with the aim of making other scientists wanting to tackle such issues and to strengthen their interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together cutting-edge know-how from medicine, computer science, physics, and mathematics to bear on medical physics problems at hand.},

In both cases, our explicit kernel formula allows for the use of high-degree splines; these offer better approximation performance than the conventional lower-degree formulations (e.g., piecewise constant or piecewise linear models).

	abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculation algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing “radiographs,” which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array. Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional CT array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in fortran-77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array.},

For high resolution iterative image reconstruction with large amount of sample events, computing the projections event-by-event is an extremely time consuming task. This paper presents a novel ray-tracing calculation technique applying to a list-mode EM image reconstruction algorithm as a part of the system model to accelerate its projection operations. Compared to both the conventional Siddon algorithm and its accelerated methods, the new algorithm has less average computation operation time on each voxel. The results show that the new algorithm signiﬁcantly improves the calculation speed up to twice as fast than the incremental Siddon algorithm.},

Attenuation factors are calculated for each pixel during the projection and backprojection operations instead of using precalculated values. The calculation of the factors requires a specification of the attenuation distribution, estimated either from an assumed constant distribution and an approximate body outline or from transmission measurements. The distribution of attenuation coefficientsis stored in memory for efficient access during the projection and backprojection operations. The reconstruction of the source distribution is obtained by using a conjugate gradient or SIRTtype iterative algorithm which requires one projection and one backprojection operation for each iteration.},

The new method, which we call distance-driven, reconciles the advantages of the common pixel-driven and ray-driven methods. It avoids an artifact-inducing approximation made by the previous methods and has very favorable computational properties. The method is applicable to parallel-beam, fanbeam, and cone-beam geometries. Its performance and artifact behavior are evaluated on a two-dimensional fan-beam geometry with flat detector and compared to the pixel-driven and ray-driven approaches. The distance-driven method prevents the artifacts that are generated in the pixel-driven projection and in the ray-driven backprojection. It outperforms pixel-driven and ray-driven methods from a computational standpoint and is amenable to hardware implementation.},

The distance-driven (DD) projection and backprojection are widely used for their favorable image quality properties, highly sequential memory access pattern and low arithmetic cost. However, a typical DD implementation has an inner loop that adjusts the calculation depending on the relative position between voxel and detector cell boundaries. The irregularity of the branch behavior makes it inefficient to be implemented on massively parallel computing devices, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Such irregular branch behaviors can be eliminated by factorizing the DD operation as three branchless steps: integration, linear interpolation, and differentiation, all of which are highly amenable to massive vectorization. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a highly parallel branchless DD algorithm for three-dimensional cone beam CT. The algorithm utilizes the texture memory and hardware interpolation on GPUs to achieve fast computational speed. The developed branchless DD algorithm achieved 137-fold speedup for forward projection and 188-fold speedup for backprojection relative to a single-thread CPU implementation. Compared with a state-of-the-art 32-thread CPU implementation, the proposed branchless DD achieved eight-fold acceleration for forward projection and ten-fold acceleration for backprojection. The GPU-based branchless DD method was evaluated by iterative reconstruction algorithms with both simulation and real datasets. It obtained visually identical images as the CPU reference algorithm.},

However, the computation burden of 3D cone-beam forward and back-projectors is one of the greatest challenges facing practical adoption of iterative methods for X-ray CT. Moreover, projector accuracy is also important for iterative methods. This paper describes two new separable footprint (SF) projector methods that approximate the voxel footprint functions as 2D separable functions. Because of the separability of these footprint functions, calculating their integrals over a detector cell is greatly simplified and can be implemented efficiently. The SF-TR projector uses trapezoid functions in the transaxial direction and rectangular functions in the axial direction, whereas the SF-TT projector uses trapezoid functions in both directions. Simulations and experiments showed that both SF projector methods are more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) projector, which is a current state-of-the-art method in the field. The SF-TT projector is more accurate than the SF-TR projector for rays associated with large cone angles. The SF-TR projector has similar computation speed with the DD projector and the SF-TT projector is about two times slower.},

Moreover, forward and back-projector accuracy is also crucial to iterative reconstruction methods. We previously described a computationally efﬁcient projector that approximates the voxel footprint functions by the 2D separable products of trapezoid functions in the transaxial plane and rectangular functions in the axial direction [1], [2]. The separability of these footprint functions simpliﬁes calculating their integrals over rectangular detector cells. We showed that this separable footprint (SF-TR) method was more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) method but with comparable computation time. This paper describes a new extension of that projector, called the SF-TT projector, that uses trapezoid functions in both directions. We show that using a trapezoid along the axial direction improves projector accuracy for voxels associated with larger cone angles. However, this improved accuracy requires increased computation compared to the rectangular approximation. Having both options available facilitates evaluation of the trade offs between accuracy and computation for different cone-beam geometries.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Iterative reconstruction methods often offer better imaging quality and allow for reconstructions with lower imaging dose than classical methods in computed tomography. However, the computational speed is a major concern for these iterative methods, for which the x-ray transform and its adjoint are two most time-consuming components. The speed issue becomes even notable for the 3D imaging such as cone beam scans or helical scans, since the x-ray transform and its adjoint are frequently computed as there is usually not enough computer memory to save the corresponding system matrix. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the algorithm for computing the x-ray transform and its adjoint, and their parallel computation.
Methods: The fast and highly parallelizable algorithms for the x-ray transform and its adjoint are proposed for the inﬁnitely narrow beam in both 2D and 3D. The extension of these fast algorithms to the ﬁnite-size beam is proposed in 2D and discussed in 3D.
Results: The CPU and GPU codes are available at https://sites.google.com/site/fastxraytransform. The proposed algorithm is faster than Siddon’s algorithm for computing the x-ray transform. In particular, the improvement for the parallel computation can be an order of magnitude.
Conclusions: The authors have proposed fast and highly parallelizable algorithms for the x-ray transform and its adjoint, which are extendable for the ﬁnite-size beam. The proposed algorithms are suitable for parallel computing in the sense that the computational cost per parallel thread is O(1). © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The Bayesian paradigm provides tools to estimate the statistics of the discretization error that is made part of the measurement and modelling errors of the estimation problem. This approach also provides tools to reduce the dimensionality of inverse problems in a controlled manner. The ideas are demonstrated with a computed example.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Discretizing tomographic forward and backward operations is a crucial step in the design of model-based reconstruction algorithms. Standard projectors rely on linear interpolation, whose adjoint introduces discretization errors during backprojection. More advanced techniques are obtained through geometric footprint models that may present a high computational cost and an inner logic that is not suitable for implementation on massively parallel computing architectures. In this work, we take a fresh look at the discretization of resampling transforms and focus on the issue of magniﬁcation-induced local sampling variations by introducing a new magniﬁcation-driven interpolation approach for tomography.
Methods: Starting from the existing literature on spline interpolation for magniﬁcation purposes, we provide a mathematical formulation for discretizing a one-dimensional homography. We then extend our approach to two-dimensional representations in order to account for the geometry of cone-beam computed tomography with a ﬂat panel detector. Our new method relies on the decomposition of signals onto a space generated by nonuniform B-splines so as to capture the spatially varying magniﬁcation that locally affects sampling. We propose various degrees of approximations for a rapid implementation of the proposed approach. Our framework allows us to deﬁne a novel family of projector/backprojector pairs parameterized by the order of the employed B-splines. The state-of -the-art distance-driven interpolation appears to ﬁt into this family thus providing new insight and computational layout for this scheme. The question of data resampling at the detector level is handled and integrated with reconstruction in a single framework.
Results: Results on both synthetic data and real data using a quality assurance phantom, were performed to validate our approach. We show experimentally that our approximate implementations are associated with reduced complexity while achieving a near-optimal performance. In contrast with linear interpolation, B-splines guarantee full usage of all data samples, and thus the X-ray dose, leading to more uniform noise properties. In addition, higher-order B-splines allow analytical and iterative reconstruction to reach higher resolution. These beneﬁts appear more signiﬁcant when downsampling frames acquired by X-ray ﬂat-panel detectors with small pixels.
Conclusions: Magniﬁcation-driven B-spline interpolation is shown to provide high-accuracy projection operators with good-quality adjoints for iterative reconstruction. It equally applies to backprojection for analytical reconstruction and detector data downsampling.},

Compared to back-projection, parallelization efficiency in projection is highly limited by racing condition and thread unsynchronization. In this paper, a strategy of Fixed Sampling Number Projection (FSNP) is proposed to ensure the operation synchronization in the ray-driven projection with Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). Texture fetching is also used utilized to further accelerate the interpolations in both projection and back-projection. We validate the performance of this FSNP approach using both simulated and real conebeam CT data. Experimental results show that compare to the conventional approach, the proposed FSNP method together with texture fetching is 10{\textasciitilde}16 times faster than the conventional approach based on global memory, and thus leads to more efficient iterative algorithm in CT reconstruction.},

	abstract = {A concise and highly performant branchless formulation of a Joseph-type interpolating ray-casting algorithm for the computation of X-ray projections is presented. It efﬁciently utilizes the hardware resources of modern graphics processing units at the scale of their theoretic maximum performance reaching access rates of 600 GB/s within read-and-write memory, and is further shown to do so without compromising on image quality. The computation of X-ray projections from discrete voxel grids is an ubiquitous task in many problems related to volume image processing, including tomographic reconstruction and visualization. Although its central role has given rise to numerous publications discussing the optimal modeling of rayvolume intersections, a unique benchmark in this respect does not exist. Here, a 3D Shepp-Logan phantom is used, which allows the computation of analytic reference projections that can further serve as input to iterative reconstructions without committing the inverse crime. The proposed algorithm (GJP) is compared to the competing and widely adopted digital differential analyzer (DDA), which computes exact line-box intersections. It is thereby found to outperform the DDA on recent graphics processors in all respects: Despite accessing twice as much memory, the GJP is still able to calculate projections twice as fast. It further exhibits considerably less discretization artifacts, and neither oversampling of the DDA nor a smooth interpolation kernel within the GJP are able to improve on these results in any respect.},

The separable footprint (SF) forward and back projection technique simpliﬁes the calculation of intersecting volumes of image voxels and ﬁnite-size beams in a way that is both accurate and eﬃcient for parallel implementation. We propose a new method to accelerate the SF forward and back projection on GPU with NVIDIA’s CUDA environment. For the forward projection, we parallelize over all detector cells. For the back projection, we parallelize over all 3D image voxels. The simulation results show that the proposed method is faster than the acceleration method of the SF projectors proposed by Wu and Fessler.13 We further accelerate the proposed method using multiple GPUs.
